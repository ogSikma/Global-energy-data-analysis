# Global-energy-data-analysis

A small project analyzing global energy and electricity dataâ€”sources, availability, consumption, and costs. 
The dataset contains historical data from 2000 to 2020 for all countries in the world (with exceptions for certain features or years).

Data obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy

## Charts

The interactive dashboard allows you to check the global leaders in nuclear energy, fossil fuels, and renewable energy sources. There is also an option to check a single country and a specific year.
